<h1>Space Fan Art (SFA - API)</h1>

SFA-API is the prototype of an API created with Flask REST-Plus. It allow authenticated users to download and upload images from NASA. This project contains two different architectures (monolothic architecture and a microservice architecture) and showcases the OWASP Top Ten Proactive Controls, security techniques that should be included in every software development project.

<h3>Currently in progress ! ðŸ’»</h3>

> Goals to be achieved: 
> * The RESTful API server should be self-documented using Swagger, therefore with interactive documentation UI. 
> * Showcase the OWASP Top Ten Proactive Controls     
> * Implement extensive testing using Automation Anywhere.

## 1. Overview 

This API, called SFA (Space Fan Art), is an API that automatically puts a fascinating image of planets and galaxies on your desktop background. Following the best practices proven to secure a REST-API, SFA-API provides access via swagger and via web interface. Both allows authenticated users to download and upload images. THe web interface of our API has an additional feature: it automatically puts a fascinating image of planets and galaxies on your desktop background!

This project contains two Prototypes. Prototype 1 has a monolithic architecture and Prototype 2 a microsservice architecture. APOD, one of NASA's Open API's, has been used thoughout the development of both Prototypes:  

* In the monolithic architecture it was used as an API model, specially for our web interface, user authentication, Web Service Rate Limits and DEMO_KEY Rate Limits. 

* In the microservice architecture it was connected to SFA-API, so our API could therefore provide APOD's functionality which is to return the picture of the day. 


## 1.1. Monolithic Architecture

> => Design based on a monolithic architecture, using MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. The images are taken from a local database. Here a small NASA dataset of images is used (365 pictures). To create this dataset we used APOD.

## 1.2. Microservice Architecture

> => Design based on a microservice architecture. The SFA-API is connected to a NASA Open API called Astronomy Picture Of The Day (APOD), which returns the picture of the day.

## 2. Project Interface

#### SWAGGER INTERFACE

Swagger enabled the development across the entire API lifecycle, from design and documentation, to test and deployment. It has also been used as an interface, allowing: a) users authentication, b) download images, and c) upload images.     

![print](/readme_img/swagger_print.PNG)

#### WEB INTERFACE

The Web Interface is our main interface and it was built with HTML/CSS and Javascript. As swagger, it also allows:  a) users authentication, b) download images, and c) upload images. However, our web interface has an additional feature: when user downloads and image, the system automatically puts it as his or her desktop background. It has been  done with ctypes and Eel libraries.

## 8. Installation 

<h3>Using Docker</h3>

It's easy to start exploring SFA-API using Docker:

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm --publish 5000:5000 frolvlad/flask-restplus-server-example
```
<h3>Clone the Project</h3> 

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/alicevillar/sfa_api
``` 
<h3>Setup Environment </h3>

It is recommended to use XXXXXXXX a to manage Python dependencies. You will need `invoke` package to work with everything related to this project.

```bash
$ pip install -r tasks/requirements.txt
```

<h3>Run Server</h3>

NOTE: All dependencies and database migrations will be automatically handled, so go ahead and turn the server ON! 

```bash
$ invoke app.run
```
 
<h3>Deploy Server</h3>

You can deploy this project as any other Flask/WSGI application. 

## 9. Quick Start  

## 10. Authentication Details

The request body must follow the following structure: 

#### User model:
{
  "First Name": "Teresa",
  "Last Name": "Saldanha",
  "Email": "mtsaldanha@terra.com.br",
  "Password": "123"
}

That is it! 

After regitration, the system will generate the API Key.

 
<h3>User Registration</h3>

```
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/api/v1/register" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{ \"First Name\": \"Teresa\", \"Last Name\": \"Saldanha\", \"Email\": \"mtsaldanha@terra.com.br\", \"Password\": \"123\"}"
{
  "API Key": "1665Sg0UlrAq1BhZOstyPMj9DF-9d-i2o0DcIIB9",
  "Expiration Date": "2021-07-30"
}
```
The response body contains the API Key and the expiration date. Once the access authentication key expires, you have to create a new one. 


## 11. OWASP Proactive Controls

The [OWASP Top Ten Proactive Controls](https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/) is a list of security techniques that should be included in every software development project. They are ordered by order of importance, with control number 1 being the most important.


<h3>C1: Define Security Requirements</h3>

The [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/) contains categories such as authentication, access control, error handling / logging, and web services. Each category contains a collection of requirements that represent the best practices for that category drafted as verifiable statements. Successful use of security requirements involves four steps: discovering / selecting, documenting, implementing, and then confirming correct implementation of new security features and functionality within an application.

The standard provides a basis for testing security controls to protect against vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection. 

> SFA-API prevents malicious code by using secure authentication methods. We use parameterised queries to avoid SQL injection attacks. Files: users_controller.py, picture_controller.py. We protect against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in our web page, using javascript. 


<h3>C2: Leverage Security Frameworks and Libraries</h3>


<h3>C3: Secure Database Access</h3>


<h3>C4: Encode and Escape Data</h3>


<h3>C5: Validate All Inputs</h3>

 https://pypi.org/project/validator-collection/

<h3>C6: Implement Digital Identity</h3>


<h3>C7: Enforce Access Controls</h3>


<h3>C8: Protect Data Everywhere</h3>


<h3>C9: Implement Security Logging and Monitoring</h3>


<h3>C10: Handle All Errors and Exceptions</h3>
